  Use this skill whenever the user wants to integrate Loops from application
  code, backend services, webhook handlers, or server-side automation. This
  includes the Loops HTTP API and official SDKs for server-side contact,
  contact-property, mailing-list, event, API-key-validation, and
  transactional-email workflows. Trigger on phrases like "Loops API", "Loops
  SDK", "send a Loops event from my app", "add a contact to Loops in a
  webhook", "send a transactional email from backend code", or any time the
  user wants to integrate Loops into their app, backend, webhook, or
  automation. Do not trigger for CLI or shell-only requests.

# Loops API and SDK Skill

This skill helps with Loops implementation workflows from application code. Use it for backend integrations, exact request guidance, and SDK or HTTP decisions.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- integrate Loops into an app, backend, webhook, or automation
- decide between official SDKs and raw HTTP
- manage contacts, contact properties, mailing lists, events, or transactional email
- validate credentials or troubleshoot Loops request behavior from code

This skill is for implementation and operational usage, not broad email strategy or deliverability review.

## Working Style

When this skill is active:

1. Choose the right interface first: SDK or raw HTTP.
2. Prefer official SDKs for application code when the language has one.
3. Prefer raw HTTP only when no SDK is available or the user needs exact payload control.
4. Keep Loops requests server-side.
5. Verify exact behavior against the official docs or OpenAPI spec when details matter.
6. If the task is primarily about Loops CLI install, auth, shell usage, or command help, use the separate `loops-cli` skill.

Official references:

- Docs: `https://loops.so/docs`
- API reference: `https://loops.so/docs/api-reference/intro`
- JavaScript SDK: `https://loops.so/docs/sdks/javascript`
- OpenAPI spec: `https://app.loops.so/openapi.json`

## Choose The Interface

- SDK or HTTP API:
  - application code
  - backend services
  - webhook handlers
  - repeatable integrations
  Read `references/http-api.md`

If the user is working from the terminal instead of writing application code, use the `loops-cli` skill.

## Category Routing

- Auth, base URL, rate limits, contacts, properties, lists, events, transactional payloads, SDK examples, and HTTP errors:
  Read `references/http-api.md`

## Output Checklist

Aim to leave the user with:

- the right API interface choice for the task
- exact payload shapes or SDK usage
- any Loops-specific caveats that affect behavior
- the next validation step, such as a small test request or API-key check
